# Coefficient of Friction Calculator in Mine Ventilation

## This program takes the different variables of the mining site as input and gives the coefficient of friction as output.

This project is about simplifying the process of finding the coefficient of Friction in ventilation. It starts by asking the type of support system and from there it asks the relevant questions and outputs the coefficient in the end.

## How to install Coefficient of Friction Calculator

The executable file:
Download Coefficient_of_Friction_Calculator.exe and simply run it. You can find it in tags under Releases.<br>
NOTE: You may experience issues when running the executable. These issues are being resolved.

The python code:
You can clone the repository or simply download the Coefficient_of_Friction_Calculator.py.

## Work in progress

* Measurement units are not yet included in number inputs.

* The Metal support and the Wood support with four pillars still haven't been added, therefore they are inactivated.

* Aerodynamics resistance calculator will be included in future releases.
